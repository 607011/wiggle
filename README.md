# Wiggle

This program is a macOS utility designed to prevent screen sleep or display dimming
by simulating user activity when the system has been idle for too long.

The primary purpose is to keep the computer "awake" and prevent screen sleep, which
can be useful for scenarios like preventing presentations from timing out, keeping
remote desktop connections active, or stopping screensavers from engaging during
long passive tasks. Some say it was invented to fake presence in communication tools
like Microsoft Teams.
